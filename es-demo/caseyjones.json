Come all you rounders if you want to hear The story of a brave engineer Casey Jones was the rounder's name On the six-eight wheeler, boys, he won his fame The caller called Casey at half past four He kissed his wife at the station door He mounted to the cabin with the orders in his hand And he took his farewell trip to that promis'd land Chorus: Casey Jones--mounted to his cabin Casey Jones--with his orders in his hand Casey Jones--mounted to his cabin And he took his... land" }
